                    Howdy! I'm Ulises Rangel and I was born and raised in this beautiful city, Austin, TX. Shockingly enough, my college endeavors were staged at Texas A&M where I played with nano-particles, lasers, and volumetric glassware. Through chemistry I have had the privilege of witnessing and developing cutting edge technology from viewing a single molecule fluoresce to creating ordered microporous crystalline solids that are capable of removing pollutants from the air.

                    While my pursuits in chemistry have been fruitful, coding and development have lured me into a programmerâ€™s realm. This move may seem largely lateral on the surface, but, in reality, it is the same love for logic, order, and aesthetics that have gravitated me to both.

                    I love to travel and have been in seven different countries. Getting acquainted and familiar with different cultures is something that is rewarding for me. My interests include playing piano, gardening, playing video games, hiking, cycling, rock climbing, keeping fish and cats, and others!
